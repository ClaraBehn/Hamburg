        <h1 id="jump1">The Elbphilharmonie</h1>
        <p>The Elbphilharmonie is more than just a concert hall. The imposing building in the harbour has long since
          become one
          of Hamburg's most popular landmarks. Varied concert series, events and top international artists are
          enthusiastically
          received by the audience. </p>
        <p>At a height of 37 metres, the public viewing platform offers a panoramic view of the city and the harbour.
          Inside
          the Plaza are the stairways to the small and large concert halls of the Elbphilharmonie, the take-away café
          "Deck
          & Deli" and the lobby of the hotel "The Westin Hamburg". There is also an information shop with information
          about
          the Elbphilharmonie, books, CDs and Elbphilharmonie souvenirs.</p>
        <p>The Great Concert Hall follows the principle of "vineyard architecture", which goes back to the architect
          Hans
          Scharoun and his design of the Berlin Philharmonie (1957). In this design, the stage is slightly offset in the
          centre of the hall, while the tiers, which rise upwards like a vineyard, are grouped around it. In the
          Elbphilharmonie, no seat is further than 30 metres from the conductor's podium. The hall is 25 metres high.

        <h1 id="jump2">The Rickmer Rickmers</h1>
        <p>The old museum ship is Hamburg's floating landmark. A visit to the cargo ship built in 1896 is always
          worthwhile. Below
          deck there are interesting special exhibitions on maritime themes; large display boards, old photos and
          nautical exhibits
          document the exciting history of the Rickmer Rickmers. Lovingly restored crew and officers' quarters offer an
          insight
          into the sometimes rough life of a seaman. The "Gallery under the Elbe" with changing exhibitions is unique.
          The on-board
          restaurant spoils you with Hanseatic dishes.</p>
        <p>The Rickmer Rickmers has an eventful history. The tall ship was launched in August 1896 at the shipyard of
          the Bremerhaven
          shipping company Rickmer Clasen Rickmers and was named after the grandson of the shipyard owner. The sailing
          ship had three
          types of propulsion: Wind, steam and diesel. Over the next few years, the three-master brought rice and bamboo
          from Hong
          Kong to Germany and also travelled to the USA, the Indian Ocean and other countries in the Far East.</p>

        <h1 id="jump3">The Planetarium</h1>
        <p>The former water tower in the Winterhude district is home to the planetarium, which enjoys steadily growing
          popularity every
          year. It is one of the oldest star theatres in the world and, after a two-year renovation phase, also one of
          the most modern
          in the world.</p>
        <p>Every year, well over 300,000 people go on a voyage of discovery into the cosmos at the Planetarium in
          Hamburg's city park.
          Known far beyond the borders of Germany, the Hamburg Planetarium does not only offer a varied programme, but
          also outstanding
          technology. </p>
        <p>Visitors can now once again experience the magnificent panorama from the Planetarium's viewing platform. The
          view sweeps
          over the city park and the rooftops of the Hanseatic city - the view stretches from City Nord to the TV tower
          and over the
          Michel to the Elbphilharmonie. The platform can also be reached by express lift. Thousands of stars shine on
          its ceiling, giving the "passengers" a feeling of travelling into space. </p>
